# Krishna Goutham - Skillset Profile for LLM Context

## Purpose
This document captures Krishna's current skillset for use as LLM context. It enables AI systems (tutors, coding assistants, agents) to:
- Calibrate explanations to the right level of abstraction
- Build on existing strengths rather than re-explaining known concepts
- Identify gaps relative to learning goals (e.g., Masai School AI Engineering curriculum)

## Scoring Key
| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Expert | Teaches others, extensive production use, debugs complex issues independently |
| 3 | Proficient | Regular production use, builds real products, deep understanding |
| 2 | Intermediate | Has used in projects, understands concepts, needs guidance for edge cases |
| 1 | Foundational | Conceptual awareness, limited hands-on, learning phase |

---

## Core Identity: Non-Technical Builder
Krishna is a **non-developer who builds production software**. His approach treats prompting as programming. He thinks in workflows, outcomes, and user behavior rather than syntax and data structures. This is not a limitation - it's a lens that shapes how he learns and builds.

**Learning Style**: Outcome-first, reverse-engineering, learns by shipping MVPs, prefers concrete examples over abstract theory.

## How to Use This Document (For LLM Systems)

### When Explaining Concepts:
- **Score 4 topics**: Skip fundamentals, focus on nuance, edge cases, advanced patterns
- **Score 3 topics**: Brief refresher okay, move to application quickly
- **Score 2 topics**: Explain concepts with practical examples, connect to existing knowledge
- **Score 1 topics**: Full explanation needed, use analogies to known domains (product thinking, workflow design)

### Communication Preferences:
- Prefers concrete examples over abstract theory
- Learns best through building, not reading
- Appreciates when technical concepts are framed in business/product terms
- Values pragmatic "good enough" solutions over theoretically perfect ones
- Responds well to workflow visualizations and step-by-step breakdowns

### Bridge Concepts (Use These for Explanations):
- **Supabase** → use as anchor for database concepts
- **Make.com** → use as anchor for automation/orchestration concepts
- **Claude Projects** → use as anchor for RAG concepts
- **Netlify staging/prod** → use as anchor for deployment concepts
- **MVP methodology** → use as anchor for iterative development concepts
