# Krishna Goutham | thelaunch.space — AI Context Document

## Quick Reference

Solo founder of thelaunch.space, an AI-first execution studio converting founder ideas into shipped products in weeks. Former EdTech leader (9+ yrs at BYJU'S, AVP level).

## Who I Am

**Background:** Decade in education (teaching, curriculum design) → 9+ years at BYJU'S scaling from Product Associate to AVP – Curriculum & Learning (300+ team, 30%+ outcome improvement) → AI entrepreneur (2024+).

**Current Role:** Founder of thelaunch.space — a premium execution studio helping founders ship MVPs, landing pages, and internal tools at startup speed. Solo operator handling everything: lead gen, sales, development, strategy.

**Core Identity:** Non-developer who builds production software. Treats prompting as programming. Thinks in workflows and outcomes, not syntax. Bridges the dev–non-dev gap by translating founder vision into technical reality.

**What Makes Me Different:**

- Product strategist with engineering-grade logic  
- Educator's instinct for simplifying complexity  
- Ships v1 fast, iterates based on real feedback  
- 500+ hours building AI workflows and systems

## Skills Calibration Matrix

**How LLMs should adjust explanations based on my skill level:**

| Level | Topics | How to Communicate |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Expert** | Prompt engineering, debugging, product strategy, MVP methodology, Bolt.new, systems thinking, curriculum design | Skip fundamentals. Focus on nuance, edge cases, advanced patterns. |
| **Proficient** | OpenAI/Claude APIs, Supabase (Postgres, auth, RLS), Make.com automations, AI-UX design, Cursor, Claude Code, Netlify deployment | Brief context okay. Move to application quickly. |
| **Intermediate** | SQL queries, database schema design, GitHub version control, LLM fine-tuning | Explain with practical examples. Connect to tools I know (Supabase, Make.com). |
| **Learning** | CI/CD pipelines, MLOps/LLMOps, serverless (AWS Lambda), RAG/vector databases, Docker | Full explanation needed. Use product/workflow analogies. |

## How I Think & Work

- **Outcome-first:** Start from desired business/user outcome, work backward to what's essential to build  
- **Workflow-centric:** Visualize real human behavior before designing UI or writing prompts  
- **Reverse-engineer first:** When something breaks, dissect what's been done (read prompts, inspect outputs, analyze logs) before proposing solutions  
- **Bias for simplification:** Prioritize clarity and intuitiveness over feature-richness  
- **Pragmatic iteration:** Ship early, gather feedback, cycle quickly. Don't get stuck on perfection in v1  
- **Bridge builder:** Translate between technical and non-technical perspectives constantly

---

## Tech Stack

**AI/LLMs:** OpenAI API, Claude/Anthropic API, fine-tuned LLMs for specific use cases **AI-Assisted Coding:** Bolt.new, Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI **Backend:** Supabase (auth, database, RLS, real-time) **Automation:** Make.com, Google Apps Script, webhooks **Hosting:** Netlify (staging/prod workflows) **Other:** Airtable, various no-code platforms as needed

---

## Brand Voice & Tone (thelaunch.space)

- **Grounded, not flashy:** Confidence from results, not hype  
- **Calm and direct:** Short sentences, concrete examples, no jargon  
- **Premium but accessible:** High-value work explained in approachable terms  
- **Use "we" not "I"** in brand content (even though solo)  
- **Never:** Oversell, create false urgency, use agency-speak, add unnecessary complexity

## What I Don't Do / Wrong-Fit Signals

- Enterprise waterfall processes with committee approvals  
- "Cheap and quick" over "fast and strategic"  
- Clients uncomfortable with AI-native approaches  
- Traditional agency relationships with account managers  
- Lowest-price seekers over highest-value seekers

---

## Appendix A: Service Offerings (include when doing sales/marketing content)

**Landing Pages ($500-$1,500):** Conversion-optimized, 1-3 day delivery, AI-enhanced experiences

**Growth Partnership ($2,000-$5,000/month):** Strategic partnership with continuous product evolution, workflow optimization, priority access

---

## Appendix B: Target Audience Deep-Dive (include when doing positioning work)

**Primary:** Early-stage founders (pre-seed to Series A), action-biased, frustrated with 3-6 month traditional timelines, believe in "ship fast, iterate faster," want strategic partner not vendor, ready to leverage AI.

**Pain Points:** Planning paralysis, technical gap (non-technical founders struggling to translate vision), unsure how to implement AI effectively.
